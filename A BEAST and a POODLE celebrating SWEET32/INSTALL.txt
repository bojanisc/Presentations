Instructions for installation:

- You will need a Windows VM and a Linux VM.
- Recommended Linux distribution is Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS - the only reason being
  that SSLv3 will be supported out of box so you don't need to modify anything
- Install the following packages:

# apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
# apt install python python3
# apt install apache2

- Enable SSL:

# a2enmod ssl

- Put the provided ssl.conf file in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
- Your Apache server should now support SSLv3

- Copy the "Web site" directory contents into /var/www/html

- You are now basically set. You can simulate a MitM attack but if you just 
  want to demonstrate POODLE, extract the exploit from POODLEAttack-master.zip
  and run it as below:

# python3 poodle-exploit.py <IP> 4443 127.0.0.1 443 --start-block 50 --stop-block 51

  Where <IP> is your Ubuntu VM IP address.

- In Windows VM open Firefox and connect to https://<IP>
- Login with username "user" and password "sec642".
